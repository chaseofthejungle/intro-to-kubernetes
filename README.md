# Intro to Kubernetes (K8s)
**Definition/Overview:** Kubernetes ('K8s') is an open-source system/platform for container orchestration, automation, scaling, deployment, monitoring, and management (including rolling out and rolling back changes). Essential features of K8s include:

* Orchestration, including automated mounting of storage systems/devices.
* Load balancing traffic across 'pods' (small deployable units).
* Automated containerized app scalability.
* Continuous monitoring of service health.
* Replacement of corrupted containers and restarting of failed containers.
* Empowering developers to concentrate on apps rather than taking on additional environment health/requirement burdens.
* Scheduled container distribution across device clusters.
* Reducing user service availability to when they may be necessary.
